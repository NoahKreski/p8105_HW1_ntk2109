Problem 1 - Creating a data frame comprised of:

A random sample of size 10 from a uniform [0,5] distribution

A logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 2

A (length-10) character vector

A (length-10) factor vector


```{r problem_one}
set.seed(1)

question_one_df = tibble(
  uniform_samp = runif(10, 0, 5),
  logical_vec = c((uniform_samp)>2)
  
)

```

(question_one_df$uniform_samp)
(question_one_df$logical_vec)
